janwilmake,0,43464320,3,"I just built XYMake (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xymake.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xymake.com</a>), a tool that lets you convert any X (Twitter) thread into clean markdown, making your conversations accessible for LLMs, MCPs, or any API.<p>## What it does:
- Transforms any X thread URL into markdown by simply changing &quot;x.com&quot; to &quot;xymake.com&quot; in the URL
- OAuth2 login to &quot;free your data&quot; and make your threads available
- Auto-generates OG images with token counts and participant info for easy sharing
- Serves different content types based on whether the request is from a crawler, browser, or agent<p>## Why I built it:
I believe people should have the right to own and use their own data. While X&#x2F;Twitter uses our content to train Grok, we should be able to leverage our own conversations for similar purposes.<p>I built this as a proof of concept in one day (what started as a 30-minute experiment turned into a 10-hour flow state). It&#x27;s built entirely on Cloudflare Workers and uses some interesting techniques to serve different content types to different consumers.<p>## Technical highlights:
- Request identification to serve HTML+OG images to crawlers while providing raw markdown to agents
- Preloading OG image generation using ctx.waitUntil for near-instant loading when shared
- Optimized OG image rendering across platforms using workers-og<p>Try it out with any X thread - just replace &quot;x.com&quot; with &quot;xymake.com&quot;!<p>Example: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xymake.com&#x2F;janwilmake&#x2F;status&#x2F;1904080559422288062"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xymake.com&#x2F;janwilmake&#x2F;status&#x2F;1904080559422288062</a><p>Feedback welcome!

1. Ollama-powered inference (LLaMA 3.2 and other models).
2. Persistent memory via ChromaDB (store and recall data across sessions).
3. Works on CPU or GPU, tested on local laptops and free-tier cloud VMs.
4. API-first approach with &#x2F;learn and &#x2F;recall endpoints.
5. Ready-to-use React web interface + install.sh script for fast setup.<p>Use Cases:
1. Build a local AI chatbot with memory.
2. Power a self-hosted assistant that remembers conversations or tasks.
3. Add a memory layer to Ollama agents or automation workflows.

fouronnes3,43,43435438,177,"Hello HN! For the past 6 months I&#x27;ve been working on an open source python library that implements differentiable geometric optics in PyTorch. It&#x27;s very experimental still, but eventually the goal is to use it to design optical systems with a state of the art optimization framework and a beautiful code based API. Think OpenSCAD, but for optical systems.<p>Not only is PyTorch&#x27;s autograd an amazing general purpose optimizer, but torch.nn (the neural network building blocks) can be used pretty much out of the box to model an optical system. This is because there is a strong analogy to be made between layers of a neural network, and optical elements in a so-called sequential optical system. So the magic is that we can stack lenses as if we were stacking Conv2D and ReLu layers and everything works out. Instead of Conv2D you have ray-surface collision detection, instead of ReLu you have the law of refraction. Designing lenses is surprisingly like training a neural network.<p>Check out the docs for examples of using the API.
