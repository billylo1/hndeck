I built <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unbuilt.app"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unbuilt.app</a> to solve a problem I frequently faced as a developer: identifying the technology stack behind websites, especially those using newer frameworks and tools.<p>While existing solutions rely on pre-saved data or signature databases, Unbuilt performs a fresh analysis by actually loading and examining the website code in real-time. This means it can detect cutting-edge technologies that often get missed by other analyzers.<p>Technical details:<p>- Uses Playwright to visit sites and analyze their resources<p>- Queue-based architecture for handling concurrent requests<p>- Optimized patterns for detecting modern frameworks (Next.js, 
Vite, React Compiler, etc.)<p>- Dual-layer caching system for both performance and result sharing<p>The tool is completely open-source and free to use. There are no premium tiers or usage limits. I built it because I believe developers deserve better tools for understanding the web ecosystem.<p>I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback, particularly on detection accuracy and the types of technologies you&#x27;d like to see added.

Unlike &quot;normal&quot; serial terminals, it not only supports the so-called &quot;character mode&quot;, where after each keypress there is an interaction with the host computer (like with a Unix terminal), but it also has a &quot;block mode&quot;. This means, you can send it commands to define fields for input and output on the screen (like a form to fill out). The terminal then handles autonomously all the the user input, and when the user is done and presses a special key (Enter or a function key), all the entries in the form are transferred to the host in one go.<p>This is very similar but unfortunately not identical to the so-called 3270 terminals used by IBM mainframe computers. Therefore, I wrote a little C program to translate between the differing protocols of 3270 and 3151 terminals enabling a 3151 to be connected to a mainframe.<p>I made a video describing a little bit the 3151 terminal and the interface program and showing how it looks like to work with the (emulated) mainframe on an 3151. The source code and Windows binary are on github for you to try out, if you happen to have a 3151 terminal. The link is in the description of the video.",youtube.com

It was also sometimes painful to create a test page specifically for non-tech users to consume an API. I originally vibe-coded this over a weekend just to make it easier for myself to debug API requests shared as curl commands. It slowly grew into something I found surprisingly useful in my workflow, so I decided to clean it up and share it.<p>uncurl.dev takes a curl command and:
- Converts it into a visual representation
- Lets you edit and inspect all parts of the request
- Allows sharing via a unique link
- (Optionally) executes it from the server, so business or non-technical users can see results<p>Execution is currently behind login, with a cap (5&#x2F;min) to avoid abuse and manage costs. Non-logged-in users can still build and share curl commands—they just can’t execute them. The server runs each request in a Docker sandbox with strict resource&#x2F;time limits (cpu, memory, timeout, no network access outside the request).<p>It’s not meant to replace full-featured tools like Postman or Hoppscotch. It’s more of a “CLI-to-UI bridge” for fast sharing and debugging, especially in dev workflows where curl is the starting point. Think of it like Pastebin or JSFiddle, but for curl commands.<p>If you’ve ever copied a curl from an API doc and wanted a cleaner way to see it or send it to someone else, I’d love your feedback.<p>Thanks!

I often receive voice notes when I can&#x27;t listen to them — during meetings, while commuting on noisy trains, or when I don’t want to disturb others. I used to rely on an app that handled this well, until it moved to a subscription model and started requiring constant internet access.<p>I wanted something that would:<p>- Work offline
- Not send audio to any server
- Be available with a single, one-time purchase
- Support WhatsApp and Telegram voice messages directly
- Handle multiple languages<p>So I built it. It’s completely local, lightweight, and doesn&#x27;t use any AI or external APIs.
