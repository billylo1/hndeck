I&#x27;m excited to share GoCard, a terminal-based spaced repetition system I built that uses plain Markdown files as its data source.<p>I&#x27;ve always been frustrated with existing spaced repetition tools that lock my knowledge into proprietary formats or require constant internet access. As a developer who lives in terminals and text editors, I wanted something that:<p>1. Stores cards as plain text files I can edit with any editor<p>2. Works seamlessly with Git for versioning and sync<p>3. Runs in a terminal without distractions<p>4. Has first-class support for code snippets and programming concepts<p>GoCard implements the SM-2 algorithm (the same one used by Anki) but instead of a database, it uses a simple directory structure where:<p>- Each card is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter<p>- Directories represent decks and subdecks<p>- Everything is editable with standard tools<p>*Key features:*<p>- Distraction-free terminal UI built with BubbleTea<p>- Real-time file watching (edit cards in your editor while reviewing)<p>- Code syntax highlighting for 50+ languages<p>- Vim&#x2F;Emacs keybindings for efficient navigation<p>- Hierarchical deck organization via directories<p>- Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)<p>What sets GoCard apart from other SRS tools is its developer-centric approach. Create cards with your favorite editor, organize them with your file manager, version them with Git, and review them in a clean terminal interface.<p>I built this because I wanted a knowledge management system that worked with my developer workflow rather than against it. Making everything file-based means I can apply all my existing text-processing skills and tools.<p>The project is v0.1.0, implemented in Go, and available at: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DavidMiserak&#x2F;GoCard"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DavidMiserak&#x2F;GoCard</a><p>I&#x27;d especially appreciate feedback on the UX design and any suggestions for making it more intuitive for terminal users.

For the past 6 months I&#x27;ve been working on an open source python library that implements differentiable geometric optics in PyTorch. It&#x27;s very experimental still, but eventually the goal is to use it to design optical systems with a state of the art optimization framework and a beautiful code based API. Think OpenSCAD, but for optical systems.<p>Not only is PyTorch&#x27;s autograd an amazing general purpose optimizer, but torch.nn (the neural network building blocks) can be used pretty much out of the box to model an optical system. This is because there is a strong analogy to be made between layers of a neural network, and optical elements in a so-called sequential optical system. So the magic is that we can stack lenses as if we were stacking Conv2D and ReLu layers and everything works out. Instead of Conv2D you have ray-surface collision detection, instead of ReLu you have the law of refraction. Designing lenses is surprisingly like training a neural network.<p>Check out the docs for examples of using the API. My favorite one is the rainbow :) <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;victorpoughon.github.io&#x2F;torchlensmaker&#x2F;examples&#x2F;rainbow"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;victorpoughon.github.io&#x2F;torchlensmaker&#x2F;examples&#x2F;rain...</a><p>You should be able to `pip install torchlensmaker` to try it out, but I just set it up so let me know if there&#x27;s any trouble.<p>I was part of the Winter 1&#x27;24 batch at the Recurse Center (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recurse.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recurse.com&#x2F;</a>) working on this project pretty much full time.

I wanted to share my analytics app with you.<p>This project came from requirements to track certain very frequent events. I found that the cost to do it on a regular analytics product was much more than i was willing to pay. Secondly, I also wanted to use as few resources as possible. So I thought it may be a good idea to create something that may be useful for myself (and hopefully others).<p>I have been able to track a great number of events with this using ~20 MB of storage and memory which is incredible. I have been really impressed by golang as a language and as an ecosystem and would love to work more in this language going forward.<p>Some Highlights: 
1. No dependencies 
2. CLI based management 
3. Web based UI (and the server to serve it) included in the program. 
4. 20 MB install size.   
5. 20 MB memory use while running.  
6. Minimal storage requirements because it aggregates events.<p>This can be a great fit for anyone who wants to have a lightweight minimal analytics for internal events.<p>I am looking forward to your comments and feedback.",github.com
