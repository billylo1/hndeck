hntrl,0,43636031,1,1744224780,Show HN: Eventkit- a better way to work with data streams in JavaScript,story,https://github.com/hntrl/eventkit,"Hey HN! I&#x27;ve spent the last few weeks working on eventkit, an open source library designed for working with data streams in TS&#x2F;JS.<p>I had a need to track all the work associated with handling application events. If you&#x27;re familiar at all with reactive systems or what that entails, having this sort of functionality is super important.<p>If you&#x27;re familiar with observables or RxJS, this library is very similar but with better side effect management and using async generators. (I found an old HN comment that&#x27;s somewhat related [1])<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36911516"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36911516</a><p>I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback!",github.com

spruce_tips,2,43635843,3,1744224150,Ask HN: Strategies or tools for embedding multiple file types?,story,,"I&#x27;ve worked a good bit with embedding strategies for RAG. But they&#x27;ve only been for documents that are identical in structure i.e. interview transcripts.<p>I&#x27;m curious how others have thought about handling embeddings for multiple file types (txt, pdf, image, docx, ppt, etc.)? Obviously, I could handle each file type individually and then build a flexible search layer on top, but I&#x27;m concerned about the level of maintenance required.<p>One idea I had was to build a translation layer of sorts that would take some arbitrary file type in, map it onto a standardized text schema, and embed that. For images (which are much less common in my dataset), I would use an LLM to describe the image and cast that text into my standard format. The standard format would allow me to simplify the chunking and embedding logic for each file type, and make the vector search layer a lot easier to maintain.<p>I know this won&#x27;t be perfect, but I think it could solve most of what I&#x27;m trying to achieve.<p>---<p>Curious what others think about this and what you have tried.<p>Cheers,<p>spruce_tips",
