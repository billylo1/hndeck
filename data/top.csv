No endless feeds. No humblebrags. Just real people open to new opportunities.<p>We’ve already onboarded a few companies, so recruiters can reach out to you directly. But you can also connect with other standout folks and supercharge your network.<p>Just upload your resume and we´ll automatically generate your profile in under 1 minute.<p>It’s early, but feels like something people actually need.
Would love your thoughts.",heyopenspot.com
