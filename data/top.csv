AI Product Rank lets you to search for topics and products, and see how OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity rank them. You can also see the citations for each ranking.<p>We’re interested in seeing how AI decides to recommend products, especially now that they are actively searching the web. Now that we can retrieve citations by API, we can learn a bit more about what sources the various models use.<p>This is increasingly becoming important - Guillermo Rauch said that ChatGPT now refers ~5% of Vercel signups, which is up 5x over the last six months. [1]<p>It’s been fascinating to see the somewhat strange sources that the models pull from; one hypothesis is that most of the high quality sources have opted out of training data, leaving a pretty exotic long tail of citations. For example, a search for car brands yielded citations including Lux Mag and a class action filing against Chevy for batteries.
