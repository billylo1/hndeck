How can we design AI that supports human connection rather than replaces it?

ziruiyyy,3,43454771,4,"Hi all! Looking for tips from folks with consumer tech&#x2F;P2P app experience :) I’m a co-founder of an app that encourages pet parents within the same city&#x2F;neighborhood to swap pet-sitting instead of paying $$ for a sitter. It’s completely free right now, and people often say they love the idea. We gained 400+ users in the past 3 months (500+ total), with most of them based in the Bay Area. But one challenge we have right now is that not enough people have actually swapped pet-sits.<p>When designing the app, we took inspiration from P2P apps and platforms like Facebook Marketplace, Airbnb, Grindr and Tinder. How the app works is that you first set up your profile with info like photos of yourself and your pets, your pet’s info, your usual availability broken down by day and periods (morning, afternoon, evening). Then you’ll see a grid view of all pet parents and their pets sorted by distance, with the ones closest to you shown first. Once you click on their profile, you can automatically shoot them a message asking for their availability to help you pet-sit. Finally, users can request a pet-sit using our scheduling system where they can choose the length of the pet-sit, what day(s) they need it, etc. To help them build a pet parent network, we have a cash-less, time exchange system where users can earn hour credits by helping others pet-sit. Then they can use the hour credits earned to request for longer, more frequent pet-sits.<p>Understand that trust and safety is top of mind for any pet parents, so we encourage users to chat a little and meet offline first before committing to a pet-sit. We also rolled out a facial verification feature lately so users can verify that they’re a real person. Once they do that, their profile will have a blue check mark badge indicating that they’re verified. But still, not enough people actually use the app. Many of them signed up for the hype from our marketing efforts but probably abandoned the app. Some of them chatted and asked for other’s availability that just didn’t work out, but few people actually scheduled any pet-sits.<p>What’s missing from our current system? What can we improve on? How can we get more users to embrace the idea of free pet-sitting and use our app more often? We’re actively asking users for their feedback too, but thought I’d also ask fellow founders, developers and people with P2P and consumer tech experience.

To do due diligence on every single company before applying is a luxury that we simply don&#x27;t have. This is specially important when applying to little known startups. If you are like me, come first of the month, you are going down that page and applying to whatever seems a good fit, one after another.<p>The other (expected) vulnerability is when in response to the application requests are made that one would normally subject to critical consideration.<p>This month I received a response from a company that after having expressed great enthusiasm regarding my application, requested a video introduction. It should have been a red flag for me that when I provided this from a well known service provider they requested a link that did not require their logging in to that service. After providing a link that did not require a record of their access to the video, they have ghosted me and have not responded to follow ups. This felt strange and (doh) I finally started digging deeper into the names of the team members on their about page and the picture that emerged was unlike the little snippets on their about page. (Turns out their ceo is actually not a tech visionary but rather a glorified marketer.)<p>Now it is entirely possible that this is simply yet another example of the degraded social norms in our society. But it is also possible that this company is collecting resumes and video (biometrics) specially since their &quot;privacy&quot; page indicates the typical assertion of copyrights over communications with them.<p>What I will be doing going forward (and I recommend the same and expect YCombinator to also recommend this in the top post for the who is hiring thread) is to, before providing such content, first obtain an acknowledgement regarding non-transfer of copyrights and strictly limited scope of sharing of such content before providing it.

pyeri,29,43451205,19,"Classical Economics says that in the long run, it&#x27;s impossible to defy full-employment or saturate any market, <i>Lassez Faire</i> or free trade is quite the norm. Needless to say, the classical framework is based on some rational assumptions like no entry barriers to competition, free flow of information, rational actors who act in their own interest, etc. And yet, given these basic assumptions, the market indeed seemed to work that way for decades and centuries. And most global markets too, not just the freelance market.<p>The phenomenon of a &quot;long term recession&quot; or &quot;long term saturation&quot; is an unprecedented one and happening for the first time in history. From the news I read and watch, this seems to be happening in almost all sectors but freelancing is what affecting me directly. While short-term corrections of excesses and anomalies have indeed affected economic activity in the past (like world wars) but these aren&#x27;t such exceptional times. The broader narrative is one of increasing prosperity, GDP output and stock market profitability all over, yet the middle class struggles more and more to find every morsel to feed their hunger.<p>Coming back to Upwork, a massive entry-barrier in the form of having to purchase connects is itself a problematic symptom. This indicates that supply&#x2F;demand ratio is heavily tilted in favor of clients; again, this should self-correct itself in a rational market given the classical assumptions but it has carried on for several years now.<p>Another reason for an unhealthy supply&#x2F;demand ratio is &quot;brandification&quot; of things which is a symptom of excessive consumerism. This isn&#x27;t about just freelancing but the increasing cynicism and lack of trust of humans towards one another. Humans have lost empathy towards fellow human, they&#x27;d rather trust a Dominos or McDonalds than the little guy cooking French Fries or Samosas in the basement. They&#x27;d rather trust an Infosys or Tech Mahindra than the little freelancer who is struggling to make a living.<p>And from their perspective, they could be right. Apple can give them 24x7 support which I can&#x27;t, the most I can do is respond to emails or messages within a specified time. There is also the human limitation of how much Coding, Testing, Deployment and Support a single individual freelancer could provide. Does it mean the age of individual freelancers is finally coming to an end, and only big businesses and agencies will eventually thrive?<p>The only way I can see real revival of freelancing as career option happening is if society at large wakes up from its usual cynical blue-pilled bubble, and starts having some faith in fellow homo sapiens like them, not just abstract entities like brands, gpts and platforms.<p>Have a nice day ahead, and may the Logos bless everyone!",1742711230,It is practically impossible to find a freelance project these days,story,,
