&quot;This Civilisation is Finished: Conversations on the end of Empire - and what lies beyond&quot;
we find that there are 3 likely near-term endgames for society<p>(1) This civilisation could collapse utterly and terminally, as a result
of climatic instability (leading for instance to catastrophic food short-
ages as a probable mechanism of collapse), or possibly sooner than
that, through nuclear war, pandemic, or financial collapse leading
to mass civil breakdown. Any of these are likely to be precipitated in
part by ecological&#x2F;climate instability, as Darfur and Syria were. Or<p>(2) This civilisation (we) will manage to seed a future successor-civil-
isation(s), as this one collapses. Or<p>(3) This civilisation will somehow manage to transform itself delib-
erately, radically and rapidly, in an unprecedented manner, in time
to avert collapse.<p>The second option basically amounts to designing future towns that
are self-sufficient based on local production and consumption, perhaps
with trading skills with nearby towns. The towns could not rely on any
form of support they could not maintain. This includes virtually all
electronics.<p>It would be interesting to construct &quot;guidelines&quot; for structuring
a self-sustaining town.<p>For example, constructing a mechanical windmill that pumps water
to a man-made lake on very high ground. This is made from simple
technology (iron for pipes, geo-engineering, etc). It feeds a
simple filtration system constructed from rocks and soil. Deep
drilled holes could provide heated water. A food and barter economy
would prevail, etc.<p>Thoughts?",1742685306,Sustainable Future Self-sufficient towns?,story,,

www.gov.uk&#x2F;home-office<p>Rt Hon Anneliese Dodds MP<p>Dear Anneliese,<p>Thank you for your letter of 28 February to the Minister of State for Data Protection and Telecoms on behalf of your constituent, Mr  Miller [NB: that is not my title!] about media reporting concerning access to data. Your letter was transferred to the Home Office, and I am replying as the Security Minister.<p>As I know you will understand, I cannot comment on operational security matters, including confirming or denying the existence of any such notices. This has been the longstanding position of successive UK Governments for reasons of national security.<p>Successive UK governments have also been clear on the issue of online safety. We need to ensure that action can be taken against child sexual abusers and terrorists at the same time as ensuring there are safeguards for people’s privacy. The UK Government takes privacy very seriously and has a strong international reputation for protecting human rights. We know data access is invasive, and access to data only happens in particular circumstances and under strict safeguards.<p>On the wider and longstanding debate about end-to-end encryption, governments of different parties have concluded that tech companies need to make sure that end-to-end encryption still has safeguards to protect children from sexual predators, and to protect the country from terrorists. This concern is also shared by other governments around the world. The suggestion that cybersecurity and access to data by law enforcement are at odds is false.<p>It is possible for online platforms to have strong cybersecurity measures whilst also ensuring child sexual abuse and other criminal activities can be detected.<p>I hope that this response will reassure Mr Miller of the Government’s commitment to the protection of privacy whilst also ensuring action can be taken against serious threats and criminality online.<p>Thank you again for your letter.<p>Dan Jarvis MBE MP
