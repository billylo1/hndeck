Company is in aerospace development.<p>It&#x27;s been little over a couple months since I&#x27;ve started and things have not improved yet. Sspposedly a lead engineer is going to start working with my team soon; however due to continuous changes of plans, lackluster collaboration coming from other teams and still no clear directions for the future of the project the morale of the other members of my team is that of extreme gloom, and there are days I find it very hard to bother doing what I&#x27;m being paid to because 1. I feel like fighting an uphill battle against not only work activities but also my own peers and 2. the feeling is almost always that we&#x27;re simply doing busywork that will have to be redone in a few weeks&#x2F;months time.<p>Keep in mind that all of this is simply technical writing (requirements) and involves no coding at all nor a particularly deep knowledge of the underlying technology, since it&#x27;s iteratively monkey-pasted until it appeases some subjective and still unclear measures of the main customer, which also seems to have its own internal strifes regarding variability of staffing, which eventually leads to repeated re-thinking of the overall project. Worst of all is that we have to closely follow suit because some deadlines are approaching and if the project team does not manage to respect those basically the whole company is royally f*cked in the hindquarters.<p>Due to the overall situation, we (the SW team) received recent news from the project manager that for the foreseeable duration of the project (4-5y more or less) there will be no internal SW development made because of de-risking, and everything will be outsourced instead. I will personally not delve into why I think this is a dumb decision, but it is what it is; only that at this point I really don&#x27;t understand which reasons I have to keep working here, aside from the relatively cozy position (which btw does not differ much from previous positions I held). I have plans to open up a small SW startup i 5-10y time for development in this field, but that requires a non-indifferent amount of expertise whose growth would be obviously stunt from sitting idly for years to come, especially for someone with so little experience such as me.<p>I do not want to turn this into a meaningless rant, so I&#x27;m asking again for HN opinion on this: what would you personally do in this case? I feel like I&#x27;m being irrationally capricious and ungrateful for leaving a cushy job in these trying times and markets, OTOH I fear that developing no experience for several years to come is going to leave me stranded when I&#x27;ll eventually try to scale up into new roles or future endeavors, nevermind the expectation of an extremely dull day to day experience.<p>Another thing is, I really like the space sector and would love to stay in it, but the feeling I get from working in it and hearing from other people that have been doing it at different levels of seniority is that you either get startups that do not know what the hell they&#x27;re doing at frantically try to spin up some working satellite with hopes and strings, or immovable giants in which you&#x27;re parked in some role and hardly move anywhere.

After trying every framework out there and talking to many founders building with AI, I&#x27;ve noticed something interesting: most &quot;AI Agents&quot; that make it to production aren&#x27;t actually that agentic. The best ones are mostly just well-engineered software with LLMs sprinkled in at key points.<p>So I set out to document what I&#x27;ve learned about building production-grade AI systems. Today I&#x27;m excited to share &quot;12 Factor Agents&quot;<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;humanlayer&#x2F;12-factor-agents<p>It&#x27;s a set of principles for building LLM-powered software that&#x27;s reliable enough to put in the hands of production customers.<p>I&#x27;ve seen many SaaS builders try to pivot towards AI by building greenfield new projects on agent frameworks, only to find that they couldn&#x27;t get things past the 70-80% reliability bar with out-of-the-box tools. The ones that did succeed tended to take small, modular concepts from agent building, and incorporate them into their existing product, rather than starting from scratch.<p>In the spirit of Heroku&#x27;s 12 Factor Apps (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;12factor.net&#x2F;), these principles focus on the engineering practices that make LLM applications more reliable, scalable, and maintainable. Even as models get exponentially more powerful, these core techniques will remain valuable.<p>Some highlights:<p>- Factor 1: Natural Language to Tool Calls<p>- Factor 2: Own your prompts<p>- Factor 3: Own your context window<p>- Factor 4: Tools are just structured outputs<p>- Factor 5: Unify execution and business state<p>- Factor 6: Launch&#x2F;Pause&#x2F;Resume with simple APIs<p>- Factor 7: Contact humans with tool calls<p>- Factor 8: Own your control flow<p>- Factor 9: Compact errors into context<p>- Factor 10: Small, focused agents<p>- Factor 11: Meet users where they are<p>- Factor 12: Make your agent a stateless reducer<p>The full guide goes into detail on each principle with examples and patterns to follow. I&#x27;ve seen these practices work well in production systems handling real user traffic.<p>I&#x27;m sharing this as a starting point - the field is moving quickly and I expect these principles to evolve. I welcome your feedback and contributions to help figure out what &quot;production grade&quot; means for AI systems.<p>Check out the full guide at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;humanlayer&#x2F;12-factor-agents<p>Special thanks to (github users) @iantbutler01, @tnm, @hellovai, @stantonk, @balanceiskey, @AdjectiveAllison, @pfbyjy, @a-churchill, as well as the SF MLOps community for early feedback on this guide.",1744129784,12-Factor Agents: Patterns of Great LLM Applications,story,,
